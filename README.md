The goal of this exercise is part tutorial in discrete linear dynamical systems, part exploration of low frequency oscillatory dynamics, a feature that is increasingly found in datasets recorded from motor cortical regions of the brain. The tutorial part covers basics of discrete linear dynamical systems (part I) and a review of how the parameters fit by a dynamcis model can be analyzed and visualized to better understand what spatiotemporal patterns the model has captured (part II). The next part then covers how to use discrete linear dynamical systems in practice to analyze data (part III). Finally, part IV investigates what sorts of spatiotemporal patterns of data give rise to low-freuqency oscillatory dynamics that have been increasingly reported in motor cortical electrophysiology data (part IV).
